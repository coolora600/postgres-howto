I'm going to start a PostgreSQL marathon: each day I'll be posting a new "howto" recipe. Today is the day zero, and the first post is here.


My goal is to create at least 365 posts 😎


Why am I doing it?

Postgres docs are awesome but often lack practical pieces of advice (howtos)
20+ years of database experience, from small startups to giants like Chewy, GitLab, Miro - always have a feeling that I need to share
eventually I aim to have a structured set of howtos, constantly improving it - and make the systems we develop at Postgres.ai / Database_Lab better and more helpful.


Subscribe, like, share, and wish me luck with this -- and let's go! 🏊

一个很不错的postgres学习资源，都是总结的一些实践经验，我会不定期翻译一篇，并添加笔者自己的理解
